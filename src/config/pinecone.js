    `Handit.ai Setup Overview: The Complete Journey

Here's what we'll accomplish in three phases:

Phase 1: AI Observability 
Set up comprehensive tracing to see inside your AI agents and understand what they're doing

Phase 2: Quality Evaluation 
Add automated evaluation to continuously assess performance across multiple quality dimensions

Phase 3: Self-Improving AI 
Enable automatic optimization that generates better prompts, tests them, and provides proven improvements

The Result: Complete visibility into performance with automated optimization recommendations based on real production data.

Prerequisites
Before we start, make sure you have:
- A Handit.ai Account, you can create one in the [Handit.ai Site](https://dashboard.handit.ai/auth/custom/sign-up)`,

    `Phase 1: AI Observability
        
This is the Python Setup fot Observability.

Let's add comprehensive tracing to see exactly what your AI is doing.

Step 1: Install the SDK
pip install -U "handit-sdk>=1.16.0"

Step 2: Get Your Integration Token
1. Log into your Handit.ai Dashboard [https://dashboard.handit.ai/]
2. Go to Settings ‚Üí Integrations
3. Copy your integration token

Step 3: Add Basic Tracing
Now, let's set up your main agent function, LLM calls and tool usage with tracing. You'll need to set up four key components:

1. Initialize Handit.ai service
2. Set up your start tracing
3. Track LLMs calls, tools in your workflow
4. Set up your end tracing


First you need to to create a handit_service.py file to initialize the Handit.ai tracker, like this example:

"""
Handit.ai service initialization and configuration.
This file creates a singleton tracker instance that can be imported across your application.
"""
import os
from dotenv import load_dotenv
from handit import HanditTracker
 
# Load environment variables from .env file
load_dotenv()
 
# Create a singleton tracker instance
tracker = HanditTracker()  # Creates a global tracker instance for consistent tracing across the app
 
# Configure with your API key from environment variables
tracker.config(api_key=os.getenv("HANDIT_API_KEY"))  # Sets up authentication for Handit.ai services`,

    `Phase 1: AI Observability - Python Implementation Example

This example uses three main Handit.ai tracing functions:

1. startTracing({ agentName }): Starts a new trace session
   - agentName: The name of your AI Application

2. trackNode({ input, output, nodeName, agentName, nodeType, executionId }): Records individual operations
   - input: The input data for the operation can be in (object format):
     - For LLM nodes: {systemPrompt: "...", userPrompt: "...", extraDetails: {...}}
     - For tool nodes: {toolName: "...", parameters: {...}, extraDetails: {...}}
   - output: The result of the operation (e.g., generated response)
   - nodeName: Unique identifier for this operation (e.g., "response_generator")
   - agentName: The name of your AI Application
   - nodeType: Type of operation ("llm" for language model, "tool" for functions)
   - executionId: ID from startTracing to link operations together

3. endTracing({ executionId, agentName }): Ends the trace session
   - executionId: The ID from startTracing
   - agentName: Must match the name used in startTracing

Complete example:

Important: Each node in your workflow should have a unique node_name to properly track its execution in the dashboard.

Phase 1 Complete! üéâ You now have full observability with every operation, timing, input, output, and error visible in your dashboard.`,

    `Phase 2: Quality Evaluation Setup

Now let's add automated evaluation to continuously assess quality across multiple dimensions.

Step 1: Connect Evaluation Models
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Model Tokens
2. Add your OpenAI or other model credentials
3. These models will act as "judges" to evaluate responses

Step 2: Create Focused Evaluators
Create separate evaluators for each quality aspect. Critical principle: One evaluator = one quality dimension.

1. Go to Evaluation ‚Üí Evaluation Suite
2. Click Create New Evaluator

Example Evaluator 1: Response Completeness

You are evaluating whether an AI response completely addresses the user's question.

Focus ONLY on completeness - ignore other quality aspects.

User Question: {input}
AI Response: {output}

Rate on a scale of 1-10:
1-2 = Missing major parts of the question
3-4 = Addresses some parts but incomplete
5-6 = Addresses most parts adequately  
7-8 = Addresses all parts well
9-10 = Thoroughly addresses every aspect

Output format:
Score: [1-10]
Reasoning: [Brief explanation]

Example Evaluator 2: Accuracy Check

You are checking if an AI response contains accurate information.

Focus ONLY on factual accuracy - ignore other aspects.

User Question: {input}
AI Response: {output}

Rate on a scale of 1-10:
1-2 = Contains obvious false information
3-4 = Contains questionable claims
5-6 = Mostly accurate with minor concerns
7-8 = Accurate information
9-10 = Completely accurate and verifiable

Output format:
Score: [1-10]
Reasoning: [Brief explanation]

Step 3: Associate Evaluators to Your LLM Nodes
1. Go to Agent Performance
2. Select your LLM node (e.g., "response-generator")
3. Click on Manage Evaluators on the menu
4. Add your evaluators

Step 4: Monitor Results
View real-time evaluation results in:
- Tracing tab: Individual evaluation scores
- Agent Performance: Quality trends over time

Phase 2 Complete! üéâ Continuous evaluation is now running across multiple quality dimensions with real-time insights into performance trends.`,

    `Phase 3: Self-Improving AI Setup

Finally, let's enable automatic optimization that generates better prompts and provides proven improvements.

Step 1: Connect Optimization Models
1. Go to Settings ‚Üí Model Tokens
2. Select optimization model tokens
3. Self-improving AI automatically activates once configured

Automatic Activation: Once optimization tokens are configured, the system automatically begins analyzing evaluation data and generating optimizations. No additional setup required!

Step 2: Monitor Optimization Results
The system is now automatically generating and testing improved prompts. Monitor results in two places:

Agent Performance Dashboard:
- View agent performance metrics
- Compare current vs optimized versions
- See improvement percentages

Release Hub:
1. Go to Optimization ‚Üí Release Hub
2. View detailed prompt comparisons
3. See statistical confidence and recommendations

Step 3: Deploy Optimizations
1. Review Recommendations in Release Hub
2. Compare Performance between current and optimized prompts
3. Mark as Production for prompts you want to deploy
4. Fetch via SDK in your application

Fetch Optimized Prompts:

Python example:

from handit import HanditTracker
 
# Initialize tracker
tracker = HanditTracker(api_key="your-api-key")
 
# Fetch current production prompt
optimized_prompt = tracker.fetch_optimized_prompt(
    model_id="response-generator"
)
 
# Use in your LLM calls
response = your_llm_client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": optimized_prompt},
        {"role": "user", "content": user_query}
    ]
)

JavaScript example:

import { HanditClient } from '@handit/sdk';
 
const handit = new HanditClient({ apiKey: 'your-api-key' });
 
// Fetch current production prompt
const optimizedPrompt = await handit.fetchOptimizedPrompt({ 
  modelId: 'response-generator' 
});
 
// Use in your LLM calls
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({
  model: 'gpt-4',
  messages: [
    { role: 'system', content: optimizedPrompt },
    { role: 'user', content: userQuery }
  ]
});

Phase 3 Complete! üéâ You now have a self-improving AI that automatically detects quality issues, generates better prompts, tests them in the background, and provides proven improvements.`,
